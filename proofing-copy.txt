Sunday Twilight

As you lie on the couch, you can see a faint haze in the air above you.

[[Sit up]] | [[Listen quietly|Sounds]]
You sit up slowly. You notice people in the street outside your window.

[[Look outside]]
The faint sounds of laughter and music drift into the room from outside.

[[Sit up]]
Two people are dancing together. One is wearing boots. The other has a beard to his belt.

[[Look at the one with boots|Boots]] | [[Look at the one with a beard|Beard]]
The fairy has butterfly wings and her skin glows slightly, contrasting with her boots.

[[Look at the one with a beard|Beard]] | [[Tell a friend]]
The beard itself is only about half a meter long. But that's because the dwarf is a meter tall. 

[[Look at the one with boots|Boots]] | [[Tell a friend]]
You tell your friend in the room what you saw. All you receive in turn is disbelief.

[[Go see a doctor]]
"You've gone too far," the doctor says. "Smoking and tripping is all that you do!"
